# Introduction

**serialize** is a simple bitpacking serializer for C++.

Now you can easily write a bool with only one bit, or serialize any integer values from [0,64] bits while taking up only that many bits buffer.

A template based serialization system is also included so you can have one serialize function that unifies read and write.
